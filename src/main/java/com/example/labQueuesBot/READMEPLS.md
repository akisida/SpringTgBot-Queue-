NOTICE!!! My plan:

### TODO IF SERVER WILL BE LOCAL

1. Hide properties on local, add them to git ignore
2. Edit SystemProps.java to add some vars/methods for your choose
3. Get all important strings from SystemProps.java (mb rename this class)

#### IF SERVER REMOTE

4. hide properties on invisible route and close access (only for passwd)
